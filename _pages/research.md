Proteins are the molecular basis of life, and yet, we lack reliable means to predict what they do, how they do it, where and when. 
Our research focuses on the development and application of machine learning algorithms for elucidating the relationship between the sequence, structure, function and evolution of proteins. See recent works below: 

# Geometric deep learning for functional site annotation




# Generative models for peptide binder design
