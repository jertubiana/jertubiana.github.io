Proteins are the molecular basis of life, and yet, we lack reliable means to predict what they do, how they do it, where and when. 
Our research focuses on the development and application of machine learning algorithms for elucidating the relationship between the sequence, structure, function and evolution of proteins. Our current and future research articulates around three aims: 

# Geometric Deep Learning for


1.	Development of Geometric Deep Learning models for learning meaningful representations of protein structures, with applications to prediction of protein function and biochemical properties.





2.	Development of Geometric Deep Learning-based algorithms for modeling and scoring protein-peptide interactions, with applications to design of therapeutic protein-protein interaction inhibitors.

3.	Development of algorithms for inferring from viral evolution the determinants of immune response to antigens, with application to design of non-immunogenic protein therapeutics.
