I am a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor, starting Oct. 1st 2023) at the [School of Computer Science](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/computer) of [Tel Aviv University (TAU)](https://english.tau.ac.il). 
I am also affilated to the [Edmond J. Safra Center for Bioinformatics](https://safrabio.cs.tau.ac.il). 
Previously, I was a [HFSP](https://www.hfsp.org) and Edmond J. Safra postdoctoral fellow at TAU.
I received my B.Sc. (2012), M.Sc. (2014) and Ph.D. (2018) in Physics from [l'Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS)](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en). 

Our research focuses on the development of Machine Learning algorithms for elucidating the relationship between the sequence, structure, function and evolution of proteins.
We then apply these tools to identify functional sites in proteins, assess the impact of mutations on function and design new proteins. More information available [here](/research/).
