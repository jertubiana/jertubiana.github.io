## Summary
Despite being made up of only ~20 building blocks, proteins have an astounding diversity of shapes and molecular functions. This course is an introduction to Computational Structural Biology - computational methods for studying the link between the sequence, structure and function of biomolecules. After providing background on protein structures, we will present classical and recent algorithms for tackling major structural biology tasks, and demonstrate their applications. 
The objectives of the course are to: 
- Study the scientific and algorithmic principles of key tools such as AlphaFold, learn how and when to use them and how to interpret their results. 
- Deepen our knowledge of protein structures & function. 
- Study some real-life applications of dynamic programming, deep learning & computer vision algorithms for solving biological problems. 
- Apply the learned tools during a project on a chosen system of interest.
